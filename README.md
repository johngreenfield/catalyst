## Project Overview & Features

Catalyst is a web application that transforms how you approach complex tasks and manage information. It acts as a bridge between your needs and Gemini's advanced natural language understanding and generation, delivering structured, actionable insights that enhance your organization, focus, and overall productivity.

Catalyst offers the following features:

- Task Breakdown: Simply input an overwhelming task, and Catalyst instantly breaks it down into small, manageable, step-by-step instructions. It even provides realistic time estimates to help you plan effectively.

- Tone Analysis: Concerned about how your written communication might land? Use the Tone Analysis feature to analyse the tone of your emails or messages. Catalyst helps you understand how your words are perceived and offers suggestions for clearer, more impactful communication.

- Formalizer (Text Rephrasing & Style Adjustment): Need to adjust the style of your writing? The Formalizer allows you to rephrase text based on your desired formality â€” whether you need it casual, professional, or highly formal.

- Meal Muse (Recipe Suggestion): Struggling with what to cook using the ingredients you already have? Meal Muse helps you make the most of your kitchen. Simply input a list of ingredients you have on hand, and Catalyst will suggest creative and delicious recipe ideas, helping you reduce food waste and inspire your next meal without a trip to the store.

- Brain Dump Organizer (Coming soon): Turn chaotic thoughts into structured clarity. Dump all your free-form ideas into the Compiler, and Catalyst will organize them into coherent lists, prioritizing actionable items and helping you make sense of your mental landscape.

- Playlist Generator (Coming soon): Generate a music playlist to match you mood or energy levels

Catalyst is built with a secure client-server architecture, ensuring your Gemini API key remains protected on the server-side. The user-friendly frontend is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the robust backend securely manages communication with the Gemini API.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Catalyst project on your local machine. This guide assumes you have a local web server environment like [Laragon](https://laragon.org/), XAMPP, or WAMP installed, which includes PHP.

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your web server's root directory (e.g., `c:\laragon\www`), and clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/catalyst.git
    cd catalyst
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username where the repository is hosted.)*

2.  **Configure Your API Key**

    To use the application, you must provide your own Google Gemini API key.

    - Inside the `api/` directory, create a new file named `config.php`.
    - Copy and paste the following code into `config.php`, replacing `'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'` with your actual key:

    ```php
    <?php
    // Gemini API Configuration
    define('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY');
    ```
    **Important:** Ensure that `api/config.php` is listed in your `.gitignore` file to prevent your secret API key from being committed to version control.

3.  **Run the Application**

    - Ensure your local web server (e.g., Apache) is running.
    - Access the project in your web browser. The URL will depend on your local server setup (e.g., `http://catalyst.test` if using Laragon's automatic virtual hosts, or `http://localhost/catalyst`).

You should now be able to use the Catalyst application on your local machine!
