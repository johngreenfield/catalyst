# Catalyst: Your Executive Function Assistant Powered by Gemini
Catalyst is a robust executive function assistant designed to help you effortlessly kickstart tasks, break through mental blocks, and boost your efficiency. Leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of Google's Gemini API, Catalyst provides intuitive, AI-powered functionalities that support neurodivergent individuals in navigating their daily responsibilities and organizing their thoughts.

## Project Overview & Core Functionalities
Catalyst is a powerful web application that transforms how you approach complex tasks and manage information. It acts as a bridge between your needs and Gemini's advanced natural language understanding and generation, delivering structured, actionable insights that enhance your organization, focus, and overall productivity.

Catalyst provides the following core functionalities:

- Magic To-Do (Task Breakdown): Simply input an overwhelming task, and Catalyst instantly breaks it down into small, manageable, step-by-step instructions. It even provides realistic time estimates to help you plan effectively.

- Judge (Tone Analysis): Concerned about how your written communication might land? Use the Judge feature to analyse the tone of your emails or messages. Catalyst helps you understand how your words are perceived and offers suggestions for clearer, more impactful communication.

- Formalizer (Text Rephrasing & Style Adjustment): Need to adjust the style of your writing? The Formalizer allows you to rephrase text based on your desired formality or "spice level"â€”whether you need it casual, professional, or highly formal.

- Compiler (Brain Dump Organizer): Turn chaotic thoughts into structured clarity. Dump all your free-form ideas into the Compiler, and Catalyst will organize them into coherent lists, prioritizing actionable items and helping you make sense of your mental landscape.

- Meal Muse (Recipe Suggestion): Struggling with what to cook using the ingredients you already have? Meal Muse helps you make the most of your kitchen. Simply input a list of ingredients you have on hand, and Catalyst will suggest creative and delicious recipe ideas, helping you reduce food waste and inspire your next meal without a trip to the store.

Catalyst is built with a secure client-server architecture, ensuring your Gemini API key remains protected on the server-side. The user-friendly frontend is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the robust backend securely manages communication with the Gemini API.

## Key Design Principles
From its inception, Catalyst was developed with several core principles in mind, particularly focusing on the needs of neurodivergent users:

- API Key Security: We've meticulously designed Catalyst so that the Gemini API key is always managed securely on the server-side, never exposed directly in client-side code.

- Intuitive User Experience (UX): We've prioritized a simple, consistent, and highly accessible user interface. Catalyst provides clear feedback and offers customizable settings to adapt to individual preferences.

- Optimized Prompt Engineering: Through extensive testing, we've refined the prompts sent to the Gemini API to ensure high-quality, relevant, and exceptionally helpful responses for every feature.

- Robust Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling is integrated throughout both the frontend and backend, providing clear user feedback and ensuring a smooth, reliable experience.
